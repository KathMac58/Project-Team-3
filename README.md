Introduction to project
US Healthcare spend continues to increase year over year. Is the investment worth it? And does that answer change based on where you live, how much you make, if you receive government assistance, or where all of that spend is being allocated? The Outliers plan to figure that out.

What does it do: 
With the increasing investment individuals and families need to make for healthcare year over year, whether you’re on government or private insurance, there is an interest to understand if the amount personally paid is contributing to an individual’s greater good.

The Outliers aim to give peace of mind to consumers wondering the same question. For our first endeavor, we will only be looking at CMS data/spend compared to Census and Mortality data to see if there is correlation between spend, location, income, and death, but recognize there are many other avenues to compare to truly get to the root of this complex answer.

Target Audience: American population that utilizes health insurance

Data: 
2 CMS.gov Health Expenditures by State of Residence, 
1991-2020: https://www.cms.gov/data-research/statistics-trends-and-reports/national-health-expenditure-data/state-residence

What is needed to run code. There are no extra libraries or modules needed to run code, Census data was collected from the Census website and precombined for the required time period.

UsefulFuntions.py is a collection of funtions that we thought would end up being used multiple times in an attempt to streamline the coding. There is a function for linear regression, and 2 for creating scatter plots, one that utilizes linear regression and one that does not. Was hoping to expand it to include a function to change the CMS data into an easier to combine format.
